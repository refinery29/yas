# are tested against the handlers.
ignored_types: [ desktop_notification, user_typing ]

# The list of handlers yas will test against incoming data events
handler_list: [ yas.default_handler. ]

# The default handler is a catch all which replys with the
# default response defined here. As a catch all, it should always be
# the last handler in the list, or else it'll catch everything before
# any other handlers are checked.
